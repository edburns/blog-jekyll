It's been nearly 19 years since my last [trivial Wikipedia contribution]({{ site.url }}/blog/2006/10/16/i-have-made-impressively-insignificant-contribution-wikipedia.html),so high time for another one.

I recently enjoyed watching [Fly Me to the Moon (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1896747/), which got me curious about what the original TV broadcast of the Apollo 11 moon landing looked like. I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQDjy2csPP0&t=141s) which, to my surprise, had a lunar lander set very similar to the one in the movie. But this one is clearly labeled as CBS NEWS SIMULATION.

I was further curious about the names of the actors that protrayed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin? I went to ChatGPT and had [this dialog](https://chatgpt.com/share/6898357f-0e58-8000-98a8-0c9fd3cc436f). It could not find the identities of the actor, but it offered to research the matter and get back to me. I said, "sure". What do you know but a couple weeks later it sends me an email, even though ChatGPT said it could not send me an email.

> **Findings (new):**
> 
> - The best-documented “stand-in” for CBS’s Apollo 11 simulation was **Scott MacLeod**, a Grumman lunar module consulting pilot/test engineer. He appeared on-air in a suit, climbed down the LM ladder on the Bethpage moonscape, and “simulated Armstrong’s and Aldrin’s duties during the moon landing.” 
> 
> - Evidence also indicates **Tom Sylvester** of **ILC Industries** (the Apollo suit maker) suited up for CBS’s Bethpage filming prior to the landing; contemporary captions describe him climbing down a full-scale LM for CBS’s simulation package (likely B-roll used in coverage). This aligns with community documentation that CBS used Grumman/ILC personnel rather than hired actors for the second suited role. (Primary: archival captioned images; secondary: space-history forum recollections.) 
> 
> - PBS’s production history and CBS’s own retrospective confirm the **Grumman moonscape set** at Bethpage and that **two suited “astronauts”** were sometimes shown, but they do **not** name the second individual on-air. 
> 
> **Bottom line:**
> A named, high-confidence ID exists for the commander role (**Scott MacLeod**). The likely second suited performer was **Tom Sylvester (ILC)** for pre-taped segments, though CBS’s public records don’t explicitly credit him in the broadcast itself. 

Pleased with this asynchronous research feature, I decided to update the Wikipedia page [Apollo 11 in popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_in_popular_culture#Films_and_television), which I copy here in case my edit gets reverted.

> CBS news coverage of the Apollo 11 landing itself included several aspects of portrayal. Grumman engineer Scott MacLeod portrayed Neil Armstrong descending from the steps of a full-scale model of Lunar Module Eagle so viewers could see what was happening before the live TV broadcast from the moon commenced.[19](https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-081621a-scott-macleod-test-astronaut-cronkite.html) Tom Sylvester portrayed Buzz Aldrin during the same broadcast.[20](https://www.flickr.com/photos/apollo4ever/51738415385/in/photolist-2owPCX3-2nBDkMS-2htaTmr-2mPWUmz-5meN7Y-2kShh8P-2ndDPMi-2ndDHPw-2mKWj4D-389dHK-2dzTfiR-5tAwna-4mrbGe-2jqYMz1-vEi2b-5t7DDn-XXAgNC-5ifBZf-Fw2Cvs-2jmj6eK-2gfLZwd-2cWYTF9-2ez8Qj7-vEi29-4xUWzN-4JsgQq-2LN9Sk-4PJHC7-5WXLCV-a2GEF-4yzZ9z-5nqBDJ-2pF4E95-FArL7E-22JaEAF-X9CLvV-4JsgQC-a2GGa-4PGE8T-2VCVDi-9V8BT-hoKJg-2MTzTU-a2GFe-U1qENN-5puZLD-2aWUH8x-2isHfXJ-a2Jor-tp4Bg)
