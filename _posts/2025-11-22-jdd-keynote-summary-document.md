This document captures the essence of my keynote for JDD 2025 "How we lost the Internet - The information superhighway to hell was paved with good intentions".

Every one of us hearing this speech is fortunate enough to work in the IT industry at a time of unprecedented disruption. One can easily and objectively observe the pace of change accelerating right before our eyes. At times like these, it's useful to take a step out of the timeline, look back, and consider some of the ways we got here: The success of today’s Internet is built on the abandonment of its early ideals, but today's disruption provides a chance to realize some of that idealism. Let's go through each section of the speech and see how I expanded on that theme.

## The optimism of 1995

It's 1994. It's a time of openness and optimism around the Western world, including eastern Europe and especially including Poland. Several happy coincidences combine to create a global climate for broad wealth creation.

- The peace dividend following the end of the cold war.
- A broad consensus among global network reseachers that TCP/IP is the best way to connect computer networks.
- NATO has the "Partnership for Peace" in Brussels, and Poland signs it, eventually leading to joining NATO.
- For the purposes of this talk, the Open Data Network book was published.

This book was commissioned with money from the USA peace dividend allocated to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). In contrast to our present funding climate in 2025, in which the very same NAS has published a statement "‘[America can’t be great without great science](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/america-cant-be-great-without-great-science-that-is-where-the-academies-can-help),’ the NAS of 1994 was flush with cash and trying to use that cash to promote the public good.

## The reality of 2025
