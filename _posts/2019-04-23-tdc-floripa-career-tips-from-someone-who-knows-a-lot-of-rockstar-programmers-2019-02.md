In my talk at 14:10 South Center Career Track, [Career Tips from Someone
Who Knows a Lot of Rockstar
Programmers](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2019/florianopolis/trilha-carreiras-e-mentoria),
I will share some of the lessons I learned from the people I interviewed
for the [Secrets of the Rockstar Programmers]({{ site.url }}/ ) book, and
also include some tips of my own.  Though I don't claim to be a rockstar
programmer myself (or the newer term: "10x programmer"), I can honestly
say I know plenty of people that who are.

I have been extremely blessed to have been a full time telecommuter
since 2002, first for Sun, and now for Oracle.  Working in this way
presents some unique challenges, and over the years I have developed
some techniques to maintain productivity and forward career momentum,
preserving the personal benefits of telecommuting while continuing to
give the company value for their money.  Perhaps I can do another post
on the broader topic of telecommuting tips, but this post is about one
practical technique that applies to telecommuters and office workers
alike: keeping a personal timesheet.

Here's the basic idea.

1. Have a spreadsheet that is set up as a timesheet.

2. Each time a new month comes around, save the previous month as the
   current month.
   
3. Keep track of all of the time you spend working and a couple words
   about what you did.
   
I've been doing this since I started telecommuting in 2002, so I have
seventeen years of monthly spreadsheets.  Here is a sample spreadsheet you can download and customize: [2023MM-timesheet.xlsx]({{
   site.url }}/blog/assets/2023MM-timesheet.xlsx "2023MM-timesheet.xlsx").
   
Update: 2023-08-07: My employer switched to discretionary time off (DTO). I personally believe DTO benefits employers more than employees. I'm not alone in this belief. See [Why unlimited time off is often better for employers than employees](https://financialpost.com/fp-work/unlimited-time-off-better-employers-than-employees) and [Unlimited Paid Time Off: A Good or Bad Idea?](https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/Unlimited-PTO.aspx). I added a simple DTO tracking facility to the spreadsheet.
   
Like my previous post about status reports, this seems mundane and
annoying, but over time, it adds up to a valuable searchable resource.
