Since this is the tenth anniversary of JavaLand, and I have had the extreme good fortune at presenting at every one of them, I dug up the links of all my previous session picks posts.

#### 08:30 - 09:40 ring°academy REST vs. gRPC

The first slot before Fried's famous Begrüßung is unenviable, from a speaker's perspective, but there were some great ones. I chose the REST vs gRPC talk from [Sebastian Tiemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-tiemann-467206263/?originalSubdomain=de). It looks hard core technical. Both REST and gRPC are venerable ancient technologies at this point, so it's amazing how absolutely essential they still are. Let's see what Sebastian has to say.

#### 09:30 - 10:40 ring°arena Fried Begrüßung and opening Keynote

I'm sure Fried will pull out all the stops for the 10th anniversary of JavaLand. The actual keynote looks great too. I don't know [Shelly Lambert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelley-lambert-6120961/?originalSubdomain=ca), but the philosophy of being self-aware and focusing on improvement is very good to learn and apply.

#### 11:00 - 11:40 ring°arena Modern Java in Action

When I spoke of the great job that advocates are doing in my [pre-conference interview on Heise.de](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Ed-Burns-Java-kann-jede-andere-aktuelle-Sprache-in-den-Schatten-stellen-9636703.html), [Nicolai Parlog](https://twitter.com/nipafx), was one of the ones I had in mind. It's so important to show only the bits of Java that represent current recommended usage, and gloss over, or even omit entirely the parts that still remain for backward compatibility rather than being correct to continue to use. I'm confident Nicolai will do this.

#### 12:00 - 12:40 Bitburger Event-Center Teil B 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/blog/assets/20240302-bitburburger-edburns.jpg" width="200" alt="Author enjoying Bitburger 0.0" style="float: left;" /> As a longtime fan of Das gute Bitburger Pils, I'm excited that my first of three back-to-back talks on Tuesday is in the Bitburger Event Center. I'm confident that part B is the best part.

My talk is Prepare for Jakarta EE 11. I am giving this talk on behalf of [Ivar Grimstad](https://twitter.com/ivar_grimstad) due to Ivar being at the very poorly scheduled, from a JavaLand attendee's perspective, [DevNexus](https://devnexus.org/). However, I'm well qualified to give the talk because I'm the [release co-coordinator for Jakarta EE 11](https://projects.eclipse.org/content/project-lead-election-edward-burns-jakarta-ee-platform). Come to this talk to hear what's new in the very soon-to-be-released Jakarta EE 11.

If I wasn't giving a talk in this timeslot, I'd attend The (Unknown) Nifty Details of Maven Plugin Configuration by [Karl Heinz Marbaise](https://twitter.com/khmarbaise). Maven plugins are super powerful, and usable in both Maven and Gradle. But how much do you know about getting the most from the plugins you use? This talk has the answers.
