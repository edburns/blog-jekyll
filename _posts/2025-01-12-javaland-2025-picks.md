I'm very blessed to have the opportunity to speak at the 11th anniversary JavaLand conference. This is the second year the conference will be held at [Nürburgring](https://thevendry.com/venue/197499/nurburgring-nurburg-germany). It turns out it took even more time to walk between sessions. Maybe this year will be better.

Here are my previous session picks posts.

### Monday, 31 March 2024 Community day

There is also an Unconference on Community day from 15:00 - 18:30 in the Coca-Cola business°lounge 1. It's impossible to list an Unconference in a session picks blog post because I have no idea what the content will be.

#### 15:00 - 17:00 Lindner Congress Hotel Grid 4 Architektur Kata

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5376)

[Sebastian Rose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-rose-9b0617ab/) and [Alexander Schwartz](https://www.ahus1.de/) are promising an interesting learning opportunity about software architecture. The idea is to build feedback gathering into your design process so it happens as early as possible. It seems like common sense, but I suspect there is a lot about the way they propose to do it that is novel and new. I think it's worth a look.

#### 17:15 - 18:30 Lindner Congress Hotel Grid 4 Easily illustrate impactful flipcharts

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5383)

I haven't used flipcharts much, but they do seem very accessible and durable. I think I should learn more about how to use them. Sebastian and Alexander present a session inspired by the lessons from the book [Der Flipchart Coach](https://www.amazon.com/Flipchart-Coach-Profi-Tipps-Visualisieren-Pr%C3%A4sentieren-Flipchart/dp/3941965948). Because I have become a huge fan of the book [Presentation Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Patterns-Techniques-Crafting-Presentations/dp/0321820800/), I appreciate the power of a session that is based on a book. As I enter the third decade of my career, it's high time I learn how to use flipcharts to make impact.

### Tuesday 1 April 2024

#### Tuesday 08:30 - 10:10 ring°kino Deserialization exploits in Java: why should I care?

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5333)

This talk has several things going for it. First and foremost, the speaker, [Brian Vermeer](https://brianvermeer.nl/) is a seasoned veteran with a stellar track record of engaging talks. Second the topic. I'm familiar with deserialization attacks back from my JSF days: client side state saving at one time used something like serialization.  But this talk goes beyond Java to also XML, JSON, and YAML serialization. An attack vector as old as seralization attacks means the prior art for attackers is vast. This one is important.

#### Tuesday 10:00 - 10:40 ring°arena Fried Begrüßung and opening Keynote

The keynote speaker has not yet been announced, but Fried's Begrüßung is always entertaining.

#### Tuesday 11:00 - 11:40 Bitburger Event Center Teil A Building AI powered applications in Java

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5179)

There is no question that powerful forces in our industry have bet the future AI and are doing everything they can to make that future happen. I look to my old friend and former PowerPoint karaoke sparring partner [Andres Almiray](https://andresalmiray.com/) to sort the hype from the reality.

I am also presenting at this time, in ring°arena. My session is titled **A survey of cloud readiness for Jakarta EE 11**.

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5163).

My session will teach:
- What’s new in Jakarta EE 11 and why it’s interesting to Java developers.
- An overview of how to run Jakarta EE 11 on Azure, Google, and AWS.
- A deep dive in how to run Jakarta EE 11 on Azure Container Apps.

#### Tuesday 12:00 - 12:40 

Because these two sessions are so very different, I have no problem recommending them both.

##### ring°arena

If you want a soft skills session at this time, go with [Sophie Küster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-k%C3%BCster-1901b4149/)'s [One of the Lads - Things I'm tired of hearing about women in tech](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5164). First, let me appeal to your self-interest. By learning about workplace concerns are important to a cohort including a large and growing segment of the workforce, you'l improve your workplace effectiveness. Second, Sophie is an excellent and engaging speaker.

##### Bitburger Event Center Teil B

If you want a technical sesion at this time go with [Samuel Nitsche](https://developer-sam.de/)'s [Code Reading - Die unterschätzte Superkraft](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5171). Given that AI is so great at parsing text, but not so great at reasoning about it, I believe having this skill in your head will give you a big edge.

#### Tuesday 13:00 - 13:40 Business Center - Bergwerk SBOMs: Die Stückliste für sichere Softwarearchitektur

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5212)

I am choosing to highlight this session from [Richard Attermeyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-attermeyer/) because ensuring all your software produces SBOMs is a great way to be a part of the solution for building world less prone to hacking. Sooner or later, all of us will be victims. We as software professionals have a duty to make things better, or at least atone for some of the damage we have already caused.

#### Tuesday 14:00 - 14:40 ring°arena No Dependencies: Pure Java AI/LLM integration

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5166)

The legendary [Adam Bien](https://adam-bien.com) comes to JavaLand. Adam's approach for decades has been to show how you can accomplish most of what you need in an enterprise software stack with a minimum of external dependencies. As the previous session from Richard Attermeyer showed, every dependency you introduce is a security risk (that's why everything needs an SBOM, just so you can check.) While this is true, it's even better to minimize your dependencies as much as possible. Don't miss this one!

#### Tuesday 15:00 - 15:40 BMW M Showroom Learning GenAI/LLM programming with langchain4j and Testcontainers

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5207)

Mr. Testcontainer himself, [Kevin Wittek](https://wittek.dev/) is an experienced speaker, software developer, and [musician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfbDw8f-AbM). Given the centrality of testing to all software development in the past and future, and the centrality of AI to all software development in the present and future, this combination will be very important to understand. Kevin will show you how.

#### Tuesday 16:00 - 16:40 Bitburger Event-Center Teil B Walking Skeleton - Softwarearchitektur ohne Fleisch?

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5175)

I had the extreme pleasure of seeing Alastair Cockburn give a keynote when I presented at [Jaoo 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060925101953/http://www.jaoo.dk/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=27). Apparently this is one of Alastair Cockburn's more recent ideas on the further evolution of agile development. [Falk Sippach](https://www.sippsack.de/) is an experienced speaker, JUG leader, and iJUG contributor. I look forward to this talk.

#### Tuesday 17:00 - 17:40 ring°arena Boost Your Performance and Developer Productivity with Jakarta EE 11

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5169)

My colleague [Ivar Grimstad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivargrimstad) gives the productivity angle on the latest iteration of the standard for enterprise Java.

#### Tuesday 18:00 - 18:40 ring°arena What is New in MicroProfile?

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5320)

In a perfect complement to Ivar's session, my colleague [Emily Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyfhjiang/) gives an overview in the latest version of MicroProfile. MicroProfile sits alongside Jakarta EE as a collection of standards adopted by multiple vendors for enterprise Java.

#### Tuesday 19:00 - 19:40 Lindner Congress Hotel Grid 1-32401 From Zero to Secured: Live-Coding a Jakarta EE REST App with MicroProfile & JWT

[Program link](https://meine.doag.org/events/javaland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5225)

As Adam Bien has long shown, the power of combining open standard specifications in an a la carte fashion tends to help delivering maintainable enterprise software on schedule and within budget. This session is another example:

* Live-coding a RESTful app from scratch using the latest versions of JAX-RS, JPA, and MicroProfile.
* Implementing JWT-based authentication.
* Documenting REST endpoints with OpenAPI.
* Creating a responsive frontend with Angular and connecting it to the REST app.

### Wednesday, 10 April 2024

#### 09:00 - 09:40 ring°kino Don't be afraid of the final boss: Explain ideas for improvement to management

Don't miss this one. This touches on a topic I addressed on [2019-04-21]({{ site.url }}/blog/2019/04/21/tdc-floripa-career-tips-from-someone-who-knows-a-lot-of-rockstar-programmers.2019.html): "Communicating your value add". That post was about communicating your value add as an individual contributor.

> Working for big companies such as IBM, SGI, Sun, and Oracle, I’ve had the chance to sample many useful corporate trainings. Even the most mundane of these, such as “Insider Trading”, offer at least one nugget of novelty. The corporate training I want to talk about here is one I took at Sun at least twelve years ago. It was called “Communicating Your Value Add” and it was all about how to articulate your contribution to your company at performance review time. The class included a handout, “Behavior/Performance-Based Questions” whose complete text I reproduce below. For discussion and reference, let’s call this perf_handout.

This session from [Christian Seifert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cn-seifert/?originalSubdomain=de) shows how to do that for your entire team. Put the two together and you have a powerful technique for showing your contribution to the bottom line. Such efforts make it more painful for them to lay you off, and also make it easier for you to get a better job someplace else, should that be appropriate.

#### 10:00 - 10:40 Nürburgring Hotel Grid 1 - 3 Improving your skills with the debugger

The program committee did a great job this year. With [Bernd's Strings talk](#1700---1740-bitburger-event-center-teil-b-was-jeder-java-entwickler-über-strings-wissen-sollte) and this one from [Bourke Nijhuis](https://sessionize.com/bouke-nijhuis), you really get some much needed fundamentals. Even if you are late-in-career like I am, continually reinforcing fundamentals is very important. <img src="{{ site.url }}/blog/assets/20240306-fundamentals.gif" width="200" alt="Spring training fundamentals" style="float: right;" />

#### 11:00 - 11:40 ring°arena Die unsichtbare Hand im Code

Of course [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and [Sandra Parsick](https://twitter.com/SandraParsick) will do an amazing job with the community keynote. I don't know how they are going to follow-up [last year's impactful installment](https://www.doag.org/de/home/news/javaland-2023-community-keynote-teilt-eure-geschichte/), which dealt with some weighty topics. As an insider at one of these IT-Giganten, I'll be curious to see what they think is really happening inside our "Geheime Räte" (hint, at least for my employer, it is always customer obsession).

#### 12:00 - 12:40 Coca-Cola business°lounge A fun and absurd introduction to Vector Databases

My day job is mostly about the prosaic, but critical revenue and generating legacy Java apps. It's far away from new stuff like Vector Databases. As such, I need to expend extra effort to stay up on such things. This talk from [Alexander Chatzizacharias](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexander-chatzizacharias) is a great and time-efficient way to make me smarter about it.

#### 13:00 - 13:40 Bitburger Event-Center Teil B Pimp your Jakarta EE Applications

I view this talk as an essential supplement to [my 12:00 - 12:40 Tuesday talk](#1200---1240-bitburger-event-center-teil-b-prepare-for-jakarta-ee-11). [Dirk Weil](https://twitter.com/dirkweil) looks like he's going to cover lots of great stuff, including migration with OpenRewrite. I hope my booth duty schedule permits me to attend.

#### 14:00 - 14:40 ring°arena Prompt-Engineering für Entwickler

When I first started using GPT for serious work questions, I thought the phrase "prompt engineering" was far too grand a term for what I was doing. However, after working more and more with it, I realize there is a skill to it, and it pays to develop the skill. Check out this talk from my old pal [Ralf Müller](https://twitter.com/RalfDMueller) and become a prompt engineering pro.

#### 15:00 - 15:40 Bitburger Event-Center Teil B Learn Pattern Matching Through Puzzlers

This session from my old pal and JSF Expert Group alumnus [Cay Horstmann](https://twitter.com/cayhorstmann) covers yet another amazing fundamental programming language technology brought to Java developers. I'm pretty sure [Nicolai Parlog](https://twitter.com/nipafx) will have touched on it in his session on [Tuesday](#1100---1140-ringarena-modern-java-in-action), but Cay, as a professional educator, will give you a deep understanding of this powerful, yet tricky to use, feature.

#### 16:00 - 16:40 Bitburger Event-Center Teil B IfC -- Infrastructure FROM code

A lot of my job at Microsoft is working with Azure's Infrastructure As Code (IaC) technology, Bicep. This second session from [Rüdiger zu Dohna](https://twitter.com/ruezd) promises to leverage that concept even further. Historically, I've noticed that techniques which build on top of powerful abstractions can really increase productivity. IaC is definitely a very powerful abstraction, so I want to see what this one's about.

#### 17:00 - 17:40 ring°arena Open-Source Contribution - Why is it worth the hassle?

My lived experience, and the experience of the authors and experts behind [Heather and Bruno's book](#1600---1640-ringarena-developer-career-masterplan-build-your-path-to-senior-level-and-beyond), testify that it's worth the hassle. If you needed any more evidence, come to this session from [Dominika Tarsarz-Sochacka](https://www.payara.fish/teamblog/author/dominika/).

### Thursday, 11 April 2024

#### 09:00 - 17:00 Nürburgring Hotel Grid 3 Automated Code Refactoring with OpenRewrite

I've seen lots of customers asking about the kind of thing being addressed in this full day workshop from [Sebastian Konieczek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-konieczek/?originalSubdomain=de). The OpenRewrite framework, from [Moderne](https://moderne.io/) (formerly of Netflix) is a powerful idea worth learning about.
